Improves the default Windows Volume Mixer by adding some new functions and keyboard shortcuts for these:

- Changing the default playback device
- Changing the total volume
- Changing the volume of the currently focused app 

This allows one to adjust the relative volume of fullscreen applications without having to minimize the application to use the Windows Volume mixer.
