I am currently working on my Master Thesis at the lab of [Matthias Bethge](http://bethgelab.org/) under the supervision of [Wieland Brendel](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=v-JL-hsAAAAJ). My current research focuses on improving the security of machine learning applications by increasing the robustnes of neural networks against adversarial perturbations.
